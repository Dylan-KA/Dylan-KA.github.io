          <p>
            Dual Wield is a first-person shooter developed over three months using the Unity Game Engine as part of a university group project.
            Players can wield two firearms simultaneously, allowing for up to 10 unique weapon combinations to tackle the enemies they encounter.
            Our project was honoured with a nomination for the UTS Tech Festival 2024 Student Games Showcase.
          </p>
          <h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">What I contributed</h2>
          <p>
            Throughout the project's development, I contributed to various gameplay features and systems.
            Additionally, I worked on 3D modelling for several of the weapons and some elements of the levels.
          </p>
          <h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">What I learned</h2>
          <p>
            As a collaborative project, Dual Wield provided me the opportunity to apply the project management principles I studied in my university course.
            Regular reflection on our development process allowed us to adapt and improve our work continuously.
            I gained valuable experience in integrating design, programming, and artistic skills from different team members to create a cohesive final product.
            We also received feedback from playtests, which guided our development and strengthened our project.
          </p>
