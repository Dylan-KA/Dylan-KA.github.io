          <p>
            Quiz App is an iOS application developed over a few weeks as part of a group project using the SwiftUI framework.
            The app fetches quizzes on various topics via an API, providing users with a range of quiz options.

          <h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">What I contributed</h2>
          <p>
            I integrated the API to retrieve new questions and answers each time a user begins a quiz.
            This involved using JSON parsing to display the data effectively within the app.
            Additionally, I developed the UI that allows users to select the quiz difficulty, number of questions, and category.
          </p>
          <h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">What I learned</h2>
          <p>
            This was one of my early projects while I was learning iOS development for the first time. 
            As a result, the UI design wasn't fully refined, and some interface issues emerged, particularly with dynamic content, which occasionally caused the layout to appear inconsistent. 
            Despite these challenges, the project helped me build a solid foundation in SwiftUI and working with APIs.
