          <p>
            Clash of Commands is a web-based educational game designed to help IT students at UTS master 
            UNIX terminal commands through gamification. The Web Systems 31268 course is known for its difficulty, and this game makes 
            learning more interactive and engaging. Inspired by Kahoot!, it includes points, leaderboards, and increasing difficulty levels to 
            boost motivation. The game simulates a UNIX terminal, offering realistic command-line challenges that align with course content. Originally 
            planned as a multiplayer experience, it was adapted into a single-player format with a high-score system. Future updates could introduce 
            advanced topics like scripting, text processing, and command chaining. Designed for both classroom and independent learning, this tool 
            enhances engagement, progress tracking, and knowledge retention.

          <h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">What I Learned</h2>
          <p>
            Developing Clash of Commands gave me hands-on experience in serious game design and gamification for education. 
            I learned how to create targeted game mechanics to support students struggling with UNIX commands, ensuring the game was 
            both fun and effective. The project strengthened my understanding of iterative design, as playtesting and feedback 
            drove improvements. I also gained insight into ethical and user-centered design, focusing on accessibility and engagement. 
            This experience has sharpened my ability to build purpose-driven interactive experiences that solve real-world learning challenges.
