    <p>
      "Why are we here?" is a 3D animation satire on first-person shooters, heavily inspired by <i>Halo</i> and <i>Red
        vs. Blue</i>.
      It was developed over a few weeks in Unity using the HDRP rendering pipeline for a group project, where we used
      existing 3D models.
      Throughout the process, I gained hands-on experience with the complete 3D animation production pipeline,
      from storyboarding and pre-production planning to animation, lighting, rendering, and VFX.
      This project helped me develop a stronger understanding of motion analysis, character animation, and scene
      composition,
      while also giving me the opportunity to collaborate on production management and post-production tasks to deliver
      a polished final piece.
