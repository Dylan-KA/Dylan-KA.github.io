    <p>
      Snaked Together is a 2D cooperative climbing game created by a small, focused team over the course of roughly two weeks. 
      The game was developed for a <a href="https://itch.io/jam/snakejam" target="_blank">game jam hosted by SXSW Sydney</a>, challenging us to rapidly prototype, refine, and polish a unique gameplay concept within a tight timeframe.
      The result is a light-hearted yet mechanically engaging experience centered around teamwork, coordination, and movement-based problem-solving.
      Players control opposite ends of a two-headed snake, navigating hazards, color-based obstacles, and increasingly tricky platforming sections that demand precise communication and timing.
    </p>
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">What I contributed</h2>
    <p>
      I played a key role in shaping the core direction of the game, collaborating closely with the team to brainstorm and refine its central mechanics.
      I designed the level layout and progression, ensuring that each section supported cooperative play, introduced new challenges, and encouraged players to strategize together.
      In addition to design work, I also contributed to some of the programming of the project using Unity and C#.
      I also assisted with testing and refining the game's difficulty curve to make the experience both challenging and enjoyable for players.
