    <p>
      Wormy is a 2D puzzle game developed in Unity as part of a group assessment task.
      It was our first opportunity to design a game based entirely on our own ideas.
      The goal was to create a small digital game that met specific design constraints and thematic requirements.
      In Wormy, you play as a worm navigating a maze of underground tunnels to fertilize and grow a seed.
    </p>
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">What I contributed</h2>
    <p>
      While the game was designed collaboratively, each team member was responsible for creating their own level, with
      each level introducing a unique gameplay mechanic.
      I designed the first level following the tutorial, which introduced the portal mechanic.
    </p>
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">What I learned</h2>
    <p>
      This project taught me how challenging it can be to maintain a cohesive game experience when multiple people
      contribute different design styles.
      Each of our levels felt very distinct, which sometimes disrupted the flow of the game. I also learned the value of
      “finding the fun” during development.
      Based on early playtester feedback, we significantly changed the player movement system from a traditional 2D
      platformer to something that better suited our game's concept.
