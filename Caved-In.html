    <h4><b>About the project</b></h4>
    <p>
      Caved In is a cooperative first-person survival extraction game, developed over three months in Unreal Engine as part of a university group project.
      Set within a cave system, 4-8 players must collect plant samples and transport them back to the exit to open the elevator door and escape.
      However, while exploring the mine, players risk infectionâ€”forcing them to hide their condition from others.
      Infected players can secretly sabotage the team by laying traps to spread the infection further.
      We had the chance to collaborate with a sound design student, which helped us achieve our vision of an immersive survival horror experience.
    </p>
    <h4><b>What I contributed</b></h4>
    <p>
      I developed the player inventory and character selection systems, along with their user interfaces.
      I also implemented nearly all the player items in the game, including both their functionality and animations.
      Additionally, I created the user interface for the lobby's host/join screen.
    </p>
    <h4><b>Difficulties in development</b></h4>
    <p>
      The ambitious scope of implementing networked multiplayer presented significant challenges for us.
      This complexity extended the development time of each feature, as we had to address numerous edge cases in client-server interactions.
      As a result, our final submission wasn't as polished as we had hoped.
